# Evolving Cells
A life-like cellular automata with an evolving ruleset

I created this to experiment with the viability of using cellular automata as a base for artificial life. This allows multiple species/rulesets to exist alongside each other and compete for space. As one species of cell spreads and takes over it changes the environment which can open up new niches for new species to evolve and thrive. Overtime many species flourish and go extinct until the entire ecosystem is able to reach a stable state. The time this takes to happen is quite random and in rare cases the system will end up creating multiple stable ecosystems that become locked in long lasting competitions.

The results from this program have served as inspiration for many of the larger experiments I've done with artificial life. Although a relatively simple test I still believe the results are quite fascinating and hint at a lot of unexplored potential with these kinds of systems.

The code was written winter 2017.
